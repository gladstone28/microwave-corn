Yes! You can cook corn in the microwave quickly and easily. Here are a few methods depending on whether your corn is in the husk or already shucked:

Method 1: Cooking Corn in the Husk (Best for Flavor & Moisture)
Leave the husk on â€“ It helps to steam the corn inside.
Trim the silk â€“ Cut off excess silk and the stalk end if needed.
Microwave on HIGH â€“ Cook for 3â€“5 minutes per ear.
Let it rest â€“ After microwaving, let it sit for 1â€“2 minutes (itâ€™ll be hot!).
Peel & enjoy â€“ The husk and silk should come off easily.
Method 2: Cooking Shucked Corn (Without Husk)
Wrap in a damp paper towel â€“ This keeps it from drying out.
Microwave on HIGH â€“ Cook for 2â€“4 minutes per ear.
Flip halfway â€“ This ensures even cooking.
Let it rest â€“ Cool for a minute before eating.
Method 3: Cooking Multiple Ears
Place up to 3 ears in the microwave, adding about 1 extra minute per additional ear.
Rotate them halfway through for even heating.
Bonus Tip: Microwave Corn in a Bowl (Steamed)
Cut kernels off the cob.
Place in a microwave-safe bowl with 2 tbsp of water.
Cover and microwave for 2â€“3 minutes, stirring halfway.
